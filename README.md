# ModLoader 64 GUI - Native

This is the repository for the native launcher. The purpose of this launcher is to support multimedia PC's and the Raspberry PI. So that you can play on TV with Gamepad only.

# Status
Currently the launcher is in a complete rewrite and not yet usable.
The following features will be added: [TODO](TODO.md)

# Contribute
In the current status it is difficult to help. 
Since I haven't written a C program in a long time, it would be most helpful if you look over the structure and give me some tips.

# Build
You need cmake to compile the sources.
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
